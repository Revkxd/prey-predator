# prey-predator
Prey-Predator ecosystem async task for CMPLXSY

- In this model, the predator is the frog, and the prey are the insects.
- The yellow patches are flowers which serve as the insects food
- Insects must eat the flowers in order to not starve to death (run out of energy)
- Frogs must eat insects to not starve to death (run out of energy)
- After an insect eats the flower the flower has a set regeneration time in being able to serve as food again
- Both frogs and insects have a set level of required energy in order to reproduce, along with a fixed probability of reproduction
