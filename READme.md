Prey-Predator Model
# Our chosen Prey and Predator are Insect and Frogs. And the energy source of the Insects would be the flowers that are randomly generated.
# Our Prey would eat the flowers in the field in order to live and reproduce
# Whilst our Predator, the Frogs, would consume the Insects instead in order to live and reproduce.
